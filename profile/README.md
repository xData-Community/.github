## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This Github organisation serves to host projects that are built by the xData developer community.

**note: this is all just a work-in-progress; eventually the onboarding and code standards can be fleshed out. Feel free to contribute as much or as little as you want**

### The aim of these community projects are:
1. To build and share tools that have value across different projects
2. To create a platform for easy collaboration due to possible infrastructure gaps.
3. To help build our skills by creating channels for code review, feedback, etc.

### What you should and shouldn't do:
1. You should check out the ```start-here``` repo for some tips on how to get started and what kinda practices to adopt
2. You should **not** upload data or any sensitive material; everything here is private to xData Commmunity members but should be treated as public-facing
3. You should just ask around if you're not sure
